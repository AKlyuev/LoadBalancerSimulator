To run the server client combo, run python3 server.py in one terminal, then python3 client.py in another.
Note that if you quit the server, you need to wait a bit for the port to become free again to rerun the server.



Currently, we have: a server file and a client file that can connect to each other. The way they connect is by having the client specify the port number of the server it wants to connect to. 

We want:

- Multiple clients
- Multiple servers
- 1 or more load balancer files that the clients connect to, and then decide which server the client will connect to. 
- A way to collect metrics on how long this takes and how accurate it is.
